# Nyallo! (=^ â—¡ ^=)

We're Remilia (she/they), Xeon (they/them), and Takeno (she/her), alias the prettysunflower (operating) system! ðŸŒ»

We are software/website developers at the RÃ©seau Koumbit, Factorio and Touhou players, and your local trans woman/enby/plural person.

We do love doing computer/servers/code stuff, riding trains, reading yuri manga, listing to our themfriend's yapping, and making HRT in our kitchen. Oh, and sunflowers, of course, they're pretty! 

We're now working mainly on our self-hosted git server: [https://git.prettysunflower.moe](https://git.prettysunflower.moe). A few of those repositories are mirrored on GitHub for discoverability, but please don't hesitate to check our work there! ^^
